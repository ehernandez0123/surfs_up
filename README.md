## Summary

As we can see in the results of the two months, the temperature patterns remain the same throughout the whole year. However, if we wanted to get a little more specific we could've done a couple more quaries to make an even more informed decision. We could have done a query for precipitation and active stations.

Even though the temperature remains almost the same throughout the year, precipidation could not and this can affect the business's sustainability. As well as knowing which stations are the most active and which ones aren't. 
In conclusion, both of this queries could help us determine which locations are the most popular and what the weather is like in the area.
